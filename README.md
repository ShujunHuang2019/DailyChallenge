## Problem 1

### Description

This problem was asked by LeetCode.

Two Sum: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example: Given `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`, Because `nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9`, return `[0, 1]`.

## Problem 3

### Description

This problem was asked by LeetCode.

Palindrome Number: Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1: Input: `121`, Output: `true`

## Problem 4

### Description

This problem was asked by LeetCode.

Container With Most Water: Given `n` non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an`, where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, ai)`. `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water. Note: You may not slant the container and `n` is at least `2`.

Example: Input: `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`, Output: `49`

## Problem 2

### Description

This problem was asked by LeetCode.

Longest Common Prefix: Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.

Example 1: Input: `["flower","flow","flight"]`, Output: `"fl"`
